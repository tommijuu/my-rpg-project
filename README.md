# my-rpg-project
This is my first RPG project where my goal is to to implement some of the key features of an RPG game for PC in Unity.

Developing on my sweet free time :)

Once I'm far enough, I'll maybe try and implement the same stuff for VR as I recently bought a headset.

This guy's playlist of tutorials helped to get started: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxLNqnnCshwmnzbS8aN17-BlrU_3UlbCG
