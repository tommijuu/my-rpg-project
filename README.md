# my-rpg-project
This is my first RPG project where my goal is to to implement some of the key features of an RPG game for PC in Unity.

Developing this project on my sweet free time :)

A playlist of tutorials that helps: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxLNqnnCshwmnzbS8aN17-BlrU_3UlbCG

Once I'm far enough, I'll maybe try and implement the same stuff for VR as I just bought a headset.
